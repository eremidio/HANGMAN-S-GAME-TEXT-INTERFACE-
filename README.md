# HANGMAN-S-GAME-TEXT-INTERFACE-
THIS REPOSITORY CONSTAINS A VERY BASIC HANGMAN'S GAME DONE IN C++. IT USES A TEXT INTERFACE TO INTERACT WITH THE USER (A GUI VERSION IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT). IT ALSO CONTAINS A FILE WHICH EXPLAIN THE MAIN MECHANISM BEHIND THE GAME. MOST IMPLEMENTATION OF HANGMAN'S GAME USES AN ARRAY  OF CHARACTERS AS THE MECHANISM TO COMPARE THE DATA ENTERED BY THE USER WITH THE WORD THAT SHOULD BE GUESSED. IN THIS IMPLEMENTATION WE USE SOME REGEX FEATURES AVAILABLE IN THE HEADER string INSTEAD. THIS HAS THE OBVIOUS ADVANTAGES TO ALLOW THE USER THAT SPEAKS LANGUANGES LIKE THE PORTUGUESE, SPANISH AND FRENCH, WHOSE WORDS MAY CONTAIN GRAPHICAL ACCENTS TO PLAY THE GAME NORMALLY WITHOUT BEING RESTRICTED TO A SUBSET OF THE LANGUAGE WITH WORDS WTHOUT GRAPHICAL ACCENTS.
